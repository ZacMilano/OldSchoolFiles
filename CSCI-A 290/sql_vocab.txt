- Two types of databases?
  - Operational : can be altered at any moment
  - Analytical : static collection of data used to analyze past trends/events
- Database models
  - Hierarchical : tree-like; limits possible relationships btwn data items
  - Network : 'many-to-many'; 'mesh'? (visualize neural net
  - Object-oriented : far less structured; uses 'objects' of data/software rules
                      for both structure and manipulation
- Helpful info
  - Tables âˆˆ databases
  - Row vs record : record is a filled-in row?
  - Schema : set of rules that define the primary key, other attributes for the
             table/'relation' in question
  - Primary key : absolutely unique; must be different for every record in the
                  relation
  - Each record is an instance of the schema with a unique primary key
