Network/relational databases
- Components
  - AT LEAST ONE FIELD: Primary Key
    - Uniquely identifies each record
  - The "subject" of a table is either an object or an event (in general)
    - Be able to describe it with specific characteristics
  - A "field" is the smallest structure in the table/database
    - Represents a single characteristic of the "subject" of the table that
      it belongs to
    - Actually stores the data
      - One and only one value
      - Its name clearly identifies the "type" of data it stores
        - FirstName LastName ZipCode are solid examples
  - A "record" is a unique "instance" of the "subject" of the table
    - Contains every "field" that defines it, even if some of those "fields"
      contain no values
    - Every instance must have a unique name/identifier (Primary Key)
    - Think of object instances like in OOP
  - A "key" is one of the crucial components that makes a relational database
    relational
    - Each one is a special "field" within the table that performs a specific
      function
      - Foreign keys link tables together
  - A "view" is the result of a query: a virtual table composed of fields from
    various "real" or "base" tables
  - Types of relationships
    - One-to-one
    - One-to-many
    - Many-to-many
      - In a relational database you cannot directly create m-t-m
        relationships between two tables
      - Instead, create two m-t-o relationships using a linking tables
