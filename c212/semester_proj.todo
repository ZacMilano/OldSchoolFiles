[ ] Build an MVC web app
    [ ] Wants an application that gives a list of quotes as they are in a
        database somewhere. I get to choose whichever I want and make an edit,
        ave, and go back to see the change in the list of quotes. Also can
        add/delete quotes. This is the administrator interface.
    [ ] The user interface is simpler: come and you will be given a random
        quote.
        Reload the page and a random quote will be posted (could be different
        one than the one you were previously looking at (because of random
        selection of quotes from a database)).
    [ ] This project uses J A V A. Woah no way
    [ ] Java Servlets (CGI/Python) and Java Server Pages (PHP)
[ ] He will show us a working prototype
[ ] Stage two will attempt to implement:
    [ ] A "database" (the model)
    [ ] A servlet to test it
[ ] Stage 3
    [ ] Adds views (screens) and controllers (servlets)
[ ] Will also need to make a change to what we are given

[ ] MVC is a composite OO pattern
[ ] Steps in proj
    [âœ“] Set up a server
    [ ] Create, test model
    [ ] Implement functionality as a collection of views/controller(s)
